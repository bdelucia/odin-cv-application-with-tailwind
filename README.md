# React Resume Maker

- ### This all started out with me doing it in vanilla HTML/CSS/JS. 
- When adding code to add more sub-sections of a form section, the CSS was giving me issues. 
- Specifically I had trouble dealing with added sub-sections of sections like Experience. 
- CSS was a big pain (newly added sub-sections got cut off sometimes), and the React code for adding and deleting components was hard to understand.
- Then I learned about DaisyUI through a YouTube reel
- And it is awesome, so is tailwindcss. So I started from the start with a DaisyUI project!
- Components were very easy to implement, it was nice to deal with the CSS within the HTML/JSX itself, instead of having to write it in a seperate CSS file.
- DaisyUI also provides ~30 themes with base, secondary, and accent colors, each in their own opacity/shade. 

- The light theme is corporate, because this is a resume maker.
- The dark theme is dracula.

## Deployed on Vercel, surprisingly easy and free.
